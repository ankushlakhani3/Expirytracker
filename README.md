Is basic template and i know it needed too much improvement but as a starter at web development is best example to connecting database and creating site using html , css and php.
i implemented log in and sign up page you can add data to localhost mysql server and start particular session thru log in using same and it's very simple coding .

1. install xampp in your pc
2. start xampp and start mysql server for database and apache for running php files.
3. create databases users,products,documents and add particulalr details by reading form's inputs.
is basically how database works..
it's too basic site that cover most of php, css and html coding

Thank you
